## 📱 Features

- 🔍 **AI-Based Animal Recognition**  
  Capture or upload an image to identify the species using integrated machine learning models.

- 📰 **Conservation News & Blogs**  
  Stay informed with the latest blog posts, news, and updates about wildlife and environmental conservation.

- 🌿 **Educational Tool**  
  Learn about different species and the importance of preserving biodiversity — right from your phone.

- 🌎 **Offline Mode (coming soon)**  
  Access species info and blog archives even when you're off the grid.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin  
- **Platform**: Android  
- **ML Backend**: TensorFlow Lite / Custom model (replace with actual backend if needed)  
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose / XML Layouts (specify as per your project)  
- **Networking**: Retrofit / Ktor (specify if used)

## 📷 How It Works

1. Open the app and take or upload a photo of an animal.
2. The app uses a trained AI model to identify the species.
3. Results include the species name, a brief description, and links to more resources.
4. Navigate to the "Discover" tab to browse conservation articles and blogs.

## 🤖 AI Model

The species recognition feature is powered by an on-device AI model optimized for mobile performance.  

You can replace or fine-tune this model using:

- TensorFlow Lite
- MediaPipe
- Your own custom trained model

---

## 📚 Content Sources

- Official blogs from conservation NGOs and government wildlife portals
- Aggregated posts via public APIs (specify sources if available)
